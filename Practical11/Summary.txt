
Summary:
(1)The alignment scores:
Between  >DLX5_MOUSE   and  >DLX5_HUMAN: 1490
Between >RandomSeq          and >DLX5_MOUSE : -348
Between >RandomSeq          and >DLX5_HUMAN: -351

(2)The percentage of identical amino acids	for each comparison.
Between >DLX5_MOUSE   and   >DLX5_HUMAN: 0.9653979238754326
Between >RandomSeq         and  >DLX5_MOUSE : 0.031141868512110725
Between >RandomSeq         and  >DLX5_HUMAN: 0.02768166089965398

(3)Interpretations:
First, as seen in the percentage of identical amino acids, the ratio between human DLX5 protein and mouse DLX5 protein is approxiamately 1. Which means from evolutionary aspect, they are
highly related to each other. I think the reason lies in that although they are in different organisms, they actually encode the same protein. Also, the ratio between random sequence and DLX5
 protein sequence is low, which counts for the randomness of the sequence >RandomSeq . This means that there is no evolutionary relationship between the random sequence and the DLX5 
protein sequences.
Second, it is observed that higher alignment scores is related to the percentage of identical amino acids. The data shows that higher percentage correspond to higher alignment scores.
From the internet, I got that the scores in the BLOSUM matrix is calculated by the (log) ratio of the observed probability of substitution of one amino acid by another divided by the
 probability expected purely due to chance. So it's resonable that higher alignment score is observed in more identical amino acid sequences.
