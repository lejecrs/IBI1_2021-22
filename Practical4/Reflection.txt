  Firstly, I do think that I have learned a lot during this Practical section, like how to make version control using git and github, how to use online resources to
overcome difficulties that I have met. Actually, not everything went smoothly in this Practical section like not being able to push, not knowing the structure between
index and repo. But finally with the help of my classmate and teachers, I finally made it. And now I can say that I can use basic command in git and github to make 
version control.
