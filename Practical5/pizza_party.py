#1. use for Loops to ensure the continous output of a sequence. The range should be 1-64
for i in range(1,65):
#2.define a variable p and caculate p using the formula given.
#use i  as the basic variable to p to make it a sequence output.
    p=(i**2+i+2)/2
    print(i)
    print(p)
#Both i and p printed to make it more clear.
