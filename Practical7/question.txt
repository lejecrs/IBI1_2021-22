How have new cases and total cases developed over time in Spainï¼Ÿ

The plot answer to this begin at line 52 in main python file.

Explanation: I think the number of new cases and total cases were quite low and close,
which indicates that the virus didn't massly invade the country and haven't cause many
cases. It was not until about 2020/3 when the number started to surge. This might indicate
 that the Covid-19 virus began to spread massly and quickly in Spain. Also, we can see a 
distinction between the new cases and the total cases, indicating that the spreading speed 
of this virus was fast and the cure rate had been low by then in Spain.
